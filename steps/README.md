# steps

In this folder corresponding to the sequence laid out in the tutorial text, 
will be the state of the student's repository at the end of each step in the 
tutorial.

Note that each of these steps has a `go.mod` file that ensures that go 
modules do not confuse them with the root module of this repository. Do not 
copy the go.mod into your working folder as it will confuse things.
