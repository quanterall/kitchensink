// Codec is the collection of elements that creates a Human Readable Binary
// Transcription Codec
//
// This is an example of the use of a structure definition to encapsulate and
// logically connect together all of the elements of an implementation, while
// also permitting this to be used by external code without further
// dependencies, either through this type, or via the interface defined further
// down.
//
// It is not "official" idiom, but it's the opinion of the author of this
// tutorial that return values given in type specifications like this helps the
// users of the library understand what the return values actually are.
// Otherwise, the programmer is forced to read the whole function just to spot
// the names and, even worse, comments explaining what the values are, which are
// often neglected during debugging, and turn into lies!

	// to disambiguate it from another encoding or as a network or protocol
	// identifier. This can be empty, but more usually this will be used to

	// different cryptocurrency network, or between main and test networks.

	// This function can render up to base36, but by default uses 0-9a-z in its
	// representation, which would either need to be string substituted for
	// non-performance-critical uses or the function above forked to provide a
	// direct encoding to the intended characters used for the encoding, using
	// this charset string as the key. The sequence matters, each character
	// represents the cipher for a given value to be found at a given place in
	// the encoded number.

// The following implementations are here to ensure this type implements the
// interface. In this tutorial/example we are creating a kind of generic
// implementation through the use of closures loaded into a struct.
//
// Normally a developer would use either one, or the other, a struct with
// closures, OR an interface with arbitrary variable with implementations for
// the created type.
//
// In order to illustrate both interfaces and the use of closures with a struct
// in this way we combine the two things by invoking the closures in a
// predefined pair of methods that satisfy the interface.
//
// In fact, there is no real reason why this design could not be standard idiom,
// since satisfies most of the requirements of idiom for both interfaces
// (minimal) and hot-reloadable interfaces (allowing creation of registerable
// compile time plugins such as used in database drivers with structs, and the
// end user can then either use interfaces or the provided struct, and both
// options are open.

// This ensures the interface is satisfied for codecer.Codecer and is removed in
// the generated binary because the underscore indicates the value is discarded.
var _ codecer.Codecer = &Codec{}

// Encode implements the codecer.Codecer.Encode by calling the provided
// function, and allows the concrete Codec type to always satisfy the interface,
// while allowing it to be implemented entirely differently.

// Note: short functions like this can be one-liners according to gofmt.

// Decode implements the codecer.Codecer.Decode by calling the provided
// function, and allows the concrete Codec type to always satisfy the interface,
// while allowing it to be implemented entirely differently.
//
// Note: this also can be a one liner. Since we name the return values in the
// type definition and interface, omitting them here makes the line short enough
// to be a one liner.
